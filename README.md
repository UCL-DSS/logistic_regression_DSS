# DS02 - Data Science with Python

## Logistic Regression Workshop 

Welcome to this workshop about **Logistic Regression**. We will cover the conceptual and mathematical foundations of the logistic regression classifier; take a look at a simple example to learn how to implement logistic regression models in Python; finally, we will cover some performance evaluation techniques and discuss the advantages and limitations of logistic regression.

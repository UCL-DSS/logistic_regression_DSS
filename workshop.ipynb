While in a good mdel, many of the predictions will be accurate, still,, inevitably, there will be errors. Sometimes the model will misplace healthy individuals with diabetic ones (false-positives) or *vice versa*, diabetic individuals will be classified as healthy (false-negatives). Therefore, there is a wealth of measures we can use to understand and evaluate the performance of our model. "

    "We have leared how to implement a simple case of the logistic regression. As we saw, logistic regression is a relatively intuitive, efficient, and elegant classification technique which provides us with a probability for a given outcome given some observation. This makes it a very popular classifier. There are several advantages to using logistic regression. Many would say that the main one is that it does not require high computational power. In addition, it is easy to implement, even from scratch, and the interpretation is straightforward. \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Despite the great popularity enjoyed by logistic regression, it's important to keep in mind that it suffers several shortcomings. One of the main limitations to keep in mind is that it cannot handle highly complex models with many predictor variables. In addition, to give meaningful predictions, logistic regression models need to be trained on large samples. Logistic regression models are prone to overfitting. They cannot solve non-linear problems; hence, they require non-linear data to be transformed. If the dependency between the independent and the dependent variable is weak, the classifier will not perform well. In addition, if the independent variables are not in fact independent, the model performance will suffer from collinearity. \n",
